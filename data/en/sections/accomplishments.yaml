    courseOverview: The competition required building machine learning models that can determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) behind Arabic text (tweets), with a prize of 10000 USD, 5000 USD, and 2000 USD to the first, second and third place winners, respectively. The competition ran for 3 months, with 74 teams participating and submitting their predictions. Wissam ranked 3rd on the public leaderboard when the submission window closed. Top-ranked participants were then invited to submit and share their codes to the organizers for the final evaluation on another private 20,000 tweets dataset. Wissam’s submission scored the highest on the private dataset.

  - name: Second Place, OSACT4‑Shared task on Offensive Language Detection
    timeline: "May 2020"
    organization:
      name: OSACT4
      url: https://aclanthology.org/2020.osact-1.8/
    courseOverview: "The rise of offensive speech, including vulgar or targeted insults, reflects increasing polarization in society, amplified by social media. A shared task aims to detect such speech in Arabic social media using the SemEval 2020 dataset, which includes manually annotated tweets for offensiveness (OFF or NOT_OFF) and hate speech (HS or NOT_HS). The dataset is split into train, dev, and test sets, with subtasks for offensive language and hate speech detection. Subtask B, identifying hate speech, is more challenging due to its lower prevalence. Our team won second place in both tasks, advancing research on offensive content and hate speech identification in Arabic tweets."
